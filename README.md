# IMU-error-prediction-based-on-ANFIS

This project can predict the imu error by using ANFIS.  And we provide a LSTM method to compare with our method.
Our codes have been tested by a KITTI dataset. By using our code, the KITTI dataset should be downloaded.

## DEMO

  If you want to see the result visually, run the Demo.m to see the train and test result. The data of the demo used is the Y-direction of sequence-09300018.


## HOW TO USE

  The quick stat is based on KITTI dataset.
  
### First step: Delete repeated data

  We use Microsoft excel to delete the repeated data. But if it's too much trouble for you, you can write your own code to delete.
  
### Second step: Calculate position error 

  Using errorCalculation.m to calculate and obtain the position error and other input and output values.

### Third step: Predict position error

  Run Anfis.m to predict the position error of IMU and to compare the results between the predicting error and truth error.

### Forth step: Compare the results

  Run Lstm.m to get the results based on the lstem method.
